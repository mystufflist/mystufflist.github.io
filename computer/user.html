var jokes = ["What do you call a naked hand? A normally-clothed hand.","Two bronze statues walk into a bar. One walks out twice as large.","How many pirates does it take to juggle? None, because pirate antics don't consist of such a thing.","Why would a cat bring a ladder to the beach? Because, just maybe, he heard that the fish were up in the sky today.","Why did the astronaut bring a broom to space? To sweep up.","What do you call a bear with no teeth? A gummy bear with a serious identity crisis.","A chicken heard the grass whispering secrets to the mailbox, so it crossed the road. Too bad!","Nine out of ten Americans think people who drive with their phone in hand are careless, but the tenth one is too busy updating their status to notice.","I was so entranced, I couldn't breathe. I unlinked my teeth from her back and fell with mine to the wall. I stopped to take a moment, abolishing my ecstasy to reevaluate the scene. Suddenly, the feeling overtaking my body went from an erotic exhilaration to a rapid panic. Bits of her were starting to hit the bottom of my stomach. I kept crunching, trying harder than before to eat through some of her bone. I was already drenched, but I wanted more. I slouched her forward into my lap and bit through to her eye which erupted in my face. Something was forcing me to persist, even when my stomach was starting to give. Witnessing the tear of her thick skin, just like dried animal meat, but so much tastier. Even though I was having the time of my life, My stomach refused some of the hair and gristle, and I began to convulse and vomit over her lacerated face, but I continued to indulge in the experience sexually. I started penetrating her wounds - tearing them larger with the grit of my teeth, and pulling her apart. My body tessellated with hers."];</script></body></html>
